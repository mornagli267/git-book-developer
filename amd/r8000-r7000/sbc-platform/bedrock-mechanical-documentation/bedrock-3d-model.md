## Installation notes

See also: [Bedrock Mounting options](bedrock-mounting-options.md)

### Orientation

Bedrock 30W and Bedrock 60W should be installed in vertical position with at least 2 cm clearance below and above for airflow.

{% hint style="info" %}
Other mounting orientation can be considered with active cooling.
{% endhint %}


Bedrock Tile should have at least one of the walls thermally coupled to a cold plate.

## Mounting notes

### Rear panel: 2x M3 threadings. Depth 3mm

Rear panel can be used with

* Bedrock wall mounting bracket
* Bedrock DIN rail bracket
* Custom mounting fixture

### Tile: 6x M4 threadings depth 3.5 mm on each wall

The threaded holes are intended for easy attachment to a cold plate for conduction cooling. Either of the walls can be attached at any orientation.

It is also possible to attach using another fixture e.g. a custom omega bracket.

It is advised to apply thermal interface material between wall and cold plate on the entire wall area.
