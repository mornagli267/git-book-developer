## Overview

SolidRun’s AMD based V3000 COM type 7 is a highly integrated COM modules where special care was taken care for the module’s height to accomodate thin and low profile designs.

The module integrates the following features –

1. AMD V3000 FP7r2 series. Other FP7r2 processors can be assembled. Please refer to SolidRun’s sales about more details.
2. Two SO-DIMM DDR5 connected to quad independent DDR5 contorllers. Each SO-DIMM supports up to 48GByte SO-DIMM DDR4 4800Mtps memory with and without ECC; total up to 96GByte system memory.
3. Single 12v DC-input is required. 5V Standby not required and not supported.

Since this module is based on SolidRun’s Bedrock product line, it shares lots of the design and features such as memory modules that were tested -

## Description

#### Block Diagram

The following figure describes the AMD V3000 COM express type 7 Blocks Diagram.

## Simplified Schematics

Following is a link to that simplified schematics of the board :

The AMD V3000 COM express type 7 simplified schematics is intended for the following audience –

1. Software and firmware engineers that enables them to understand the IO and signal connectivity of the COM express design.
2. Hardware engineers that are willing to use the COM express and build their own solution. This document completes the reference manual from description of signal and implementation wise.

## Heatsink and Cooling

A heatsink for this COM module was developed to accomodate multiple scenarios. Please look below for rendering without a fan -

![HS00030-Rendering.png](<../../../.gitbook/assets/HS00030-Rendering (1).png>)

This heatsink can be used as in the following -

1. With 40mm or 60mm fan - please refer to the M2.5 screws on the top of the heatsink. Take into account that the max thread inside the heatsink is 6mm.
2. In a 1U chassis where an air flow goes thru the fins of the heatsink
3. Standalone - The customer is required to assemble the heatsink the fan and measure max load can be used in his specific application and specific air movement and ambient temperatures

The fan part number is HS00030 and is offered with the module when bought as samples.

Refer to the documentation section withregards 3D model of HS00030.

## Module Power Consumption Measurements

The following power consumption measurements were conducted on the following setup –

1. HoneyComb AMD V3000 mini-ITX motherboard with pico-psu ATX power source
2. AMD V3000 V3C18I processor on COM express type 7 module connected.
3. Two SO-DIMM DDR5 at 4800Mtps (total 2x48GB = 96GByte system memory)
4. During the tests a 1.3Watt fan mounted on the processor. The idle, memtester and first cpu-burn power measurements below includes those 1.3Watt, the measurements with die temperature of 65c and above has the fan disconnected.
5. Temperature measurement was done using Linux ‘sensors’ commands, that reads both the PCB (print side of the board away from the center) and the processor die temperature.
6. Software running is standard Linux Ubuntu distribution software release.
7. A 12v PSU is connected to a pico-psu (12v to ATX); and power is measured by multiplying the current and the voltage on the 12v input rail.

Since the measurement are done on the input of the pico-psu; the SoC consumption all together with the DDR and all the DC-DC losses are measured too.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note** (\*) – The Linux command is ‘memtester 100M > /dev/null &’ ran 16x times where 16 is the thread count (\*\*) – The Linux command ‘cpuburn’ is ran two times in background. The reason cpuburn was chosen since it can generate most heat out of the cores (the core pipeline most utilized). (\*\*\*) – This measurement was taken when the fan is disconnected and the power was measured when the die reached 105c. Notice that keeping the fan disconnected will make the processor reach temperatures that are out of spec.
