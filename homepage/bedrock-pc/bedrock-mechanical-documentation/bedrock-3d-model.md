## Installation notes

<a id="orientation"></a>

### Orientation

Bedrock 30W and Bedrock 60W should be installed in vertical position with at least 2 cm clearance below and above for airflow.

> [!INFO]
> Other mounting orientation can be considered with active cooling.

Bedrock Tile should have at least one of the walls thermally coupled to a cold plate.

<a id="tile-6x-m4-threadings-depth-35-mm-on-each-wall"></a>

### Tile: 6x M4 threadings depth 3.5 mm on each wall

The threaded holes are intended for easy attachment to a cold plate for conduction cooling. Either of the walls can be attached at any orientation.

It is also possible to attach using another fixture e.g. a custom omega bracket.

It is advised to apply thermal interface material between wall and cold plate on the entire wall area.
