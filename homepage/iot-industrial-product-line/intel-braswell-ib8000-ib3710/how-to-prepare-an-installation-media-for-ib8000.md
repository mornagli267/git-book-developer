## Overview

The SolidPC / E8000 / N3710 SOM is an Intel-based Chip. This means that nearly all x86/x64 operation systems should work out of the box.

First of all, get the latest .iso file of your operation system. You can also clone a current CD/DVD to get an ISO file.

An external device is also needed – for example, an USB Stick or SD Card.

The easiest way to install an iso file onto an USB drive is to use Rufus.

You can download the software here:
