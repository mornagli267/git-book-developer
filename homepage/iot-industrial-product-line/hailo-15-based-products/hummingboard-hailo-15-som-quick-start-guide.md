<a id="using-gstreamer"></a>

### Using GStreamer

Gstreamer is a CLI application that allows you to send, receive, and convert video streams.

1. Install gstreamer

For Ubuntu/Debian distros:

```
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav
```

For Fedora/RHEL distros:

```
sudo dnf install gstreamer1 gstreamer1-plugins-base gstreamer1-plugins-good gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-gtk
```

For Windows:

- **Download the Installer**: Go to the [GStreamer official website](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/) and download the appropriate installer for your Windows version.
- **Run the Installer**: Execute the downloaded file. During installation, **select "Complete Installation"** to install all basic plugins.
- **Set Environment Variables**: To use GStreamer from the command line, add GStreamer to your system's PATH as described [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-windows.html?gi-language=c).

> [!INFO]
> For Windows, you might need to configure the Firewall to allow the stream. Make sure that `10.0.0.2` is a private network.

2. Run the gstreamer pipeline to start receiving a stream.

On **your pc** In a bash terminal or Windows cmd run:

```
gst-launch-1.0 -v udpsrc port=5000 address=0.0.0.0 ! application/x-rtp,encoding-name=H264 ! queue ! rtph264depay ! queue ! h264parse ! avdec_h264 ! queue ! videoconvert ! fpsdisplaysink video-sink=autovideosink text-overlay=false sync=false
```

3. Run the demo application on the **Hailo15 EVK**:

```
root@hailo15:~# ./apps/detection/detection.sh
```

<a id="using-vlc"></a>

### Using VLC

Another option is to receive a stream using VLC media player.\\

1. Install VLCFor Ubuntu/Debian distros:
```
sudo apt install vlc
```
For Fedora/RHEL distros:
```
sudo dnf install vlc
```
For Windows:

- **Download the Installer**: Go to the [VLC official website](https://www.videolan.org/) and download the appropriate installer for your Windows version.
- **Run the Installer**: Execute the downloaded file. During installation, **select "Complete Installation"** to install all basic plugins.

> [!INFO]
> For Windows, you might need to configure the Firewall to allow the stream. Make sure that `10.0.0.2` is a private network.

2. Create a stream configuration file `stream.sdp` with the following content:

![](https://developer.resources.solid-run.com/wiki/images/icons/grey_arrow_down.png)

stream.sdp

v=0  
o=- 0 0 IN IP4 127.0.0.1  
s=No Name  
c=IN IP4 10.0.0.2  
t=0 0  
a=tool:libavformat 58.20.100  
m=video 5000 RTP/AVP 96  
a=rtpmap:96 H264/90000

3. Open the `stream.sdp` in the vlc using the `Media -> Open File` tab.
4. Run the demo application on the **target**:

```
root@hailo15:~# ./apps/detection/detection.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note: VLC inserts its own 1s latency into the stream during the network cashing. You can decrease this latency in the settings.
> - Go to Tools > Preferences.
> - Show settings: select All at the bottom left to switch to the advanced preferences.
> - Under Input / Codecs, find Network.
> - Locate Network caching (ms) and reduce its value. The default is typically around 1000 ms (1 second). You might try lowering it to 100-300 ms, but be aware that too low a value can lead to stream instability or increased packet loss.

# Firmware update process

<a id="updating-firmware-with-swupdate-recommended"></a>

## Updating firmware with SWUpdate (recommended)

A part of the yocto build is a software update package (.swu). This image contains a full rootfs image, bootloaders, and qSPI content and will automatically flash all the artifacts in places.

1. Run an HTTP server on port 80 in the directory with the update image (.swu)

```
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

2. Reset the board. In the u-boot menu, select `SWUpdate`

```
  *** U-Boot Boot Menu ***

     Boot from eMMC
     Boot to flashing ramdisk
*    SWUpdate
     U-Boot console


  Press UP/DOWN to move, ENTER to select, ESC/CTRL+C to quit
```

> [!INFO]
> If there is no SWUpdate item in the menu or an update was unsuccessful for any reason, please proceed to the next chapter “Manual firmware reflashing“.

> [!INFO]
> A/B updates will be added in future firmware releases.

3. The board will boot, load the update image from IP 10.0.0.2, port 80 and update all the firmware components.

## Manual firmware reflashing

<a id="flashing-qspi-flash"></a>

### Flashing QSPI flash

Reflashing QSPI is only possible under Linux.

> [!WARNING]
> Please make sure that u-boot-tools are installed in your system:
> - For Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install u-boot-tools`
> - For Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install uboot-tools`

1. Download the flashing tool and install it into your system.

```
python3 -m pip install hailo15_board_tools-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
```

2. Set the DIP switch to the [Serial download mode](../hailo-15-based-products/hailo-15-other-articles/hummingboard-hailo-15-boot-select.md).
3. **Close the serial terminal on your PC**.
4. Reset the board.
5. Upload the uart flashing firmware into the SOM:

```
uart_boot_fw_loader --serial-device-name /dev/ttyUSB0 --firmware hailo15_uart_recovery_fw.bin 
```

6. Reflash QSPI content:

```
hailo15_spi_flash_program --serial-device-name /dev/ttyUSB0 --uart-load --scu-bootloader ./hailo15_scu_bl.bin --scu-bootloader-config scu_bl_cfg_a.bin --scu-firmware ./hailo15_scu_fw.bin --uboot-device-tree ./u-boot.dtb.signed --bootloader ./u-boot-spl.bin --bootloader-env ./u-boot-initial-env --customer-certificate ./customer_certificate.bin
```

> [!INFO]
> Note: `hailo15_spi_flash_program` also allows to reflash selected parts of the QSPI Flash:
> - `hailo15_spi_flash_program --serial-device-name /dev/ttyUSB0 --uart-load --bootloader ./u-boot-spl.bin --bootloader-env ./u-boot-initial-env--scu-bootloader ./hailo15_scu_bl.bin`
> - `hailo15_spi_flash_program --serial-device-name /dev/ttyUSB0 --uart-load --uboot-device-tree ./u-boot.dtb.signed`
> - etc.

> [!WARNING]
> This guide assumes that your serial terminal is `/dev/ttyUSB0`. Replace it with the proper device for your system.

<a id="sending-u-boot-over-uart"></a>

### Sending u-boot over uart

Hailo FW expects a firmware version match between proprietary firmware, SPL, u-boot, and kernel. After qSPI firmware was reflashed with uart boot mode, u-boot with the same fw version should be loaded. SPL uses the UART Y-Modem mode to load the `u-boot-tfa.itb` file over the serial connection.

1. Set the DIP switch to the [qSPI boot with Y-modem u-boot load](../hailo-15-based-products/hailo-15-other-articles/hummingboard-hailo-15-boot-select.md).
2. Reset the board. You will see the board booted to SPL and expects u-boot to be sent with Y-modem:

> U-Boot SPL 2022.01 (Feb 04 2024 - 18:42:25 +0000)  
> Loading Environment from SPIFlash... OK  
> U-Boot SPL boot source uart  
> CCCCCCCCCC

The SPL waits for the Y-modem transfer to upload the u-boot into the RAM. The latest minicom already has a built-in Y-modem transfer function. With minicom, press Ctrl+A, then S, select `ymodem`, and then choose file `u-boot-tfa.itb`. Note: the transfer can take a few minutes. As soon as the u-boot is completely transferred, you will see the same u-boot entries as usual Proceed to the restoring eMMC with ramdisk.

<a id="restoring-emmc-content"></a>

### Restoring eMMC content.

The u-boot menu has a special entry that allows you to load a ramdisk from an HTTP server and boot to it.

1. Run an HTTP server on port 80 in the directory with the image

```
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

2. In the u-boot menu, select `Boot to flashing ramdisk`
3. The Board will grub a ramdisk from the HTTP server on IP 10.0.0.2, port 80, and boot to it.
4. Once the board is booted to the ramdisk, flash eMMC:

```
bmaptool copy http://10.0.0.2/core-image-minimal-hailo15-solidrun.wic.zst /dev/mmcblk1
```

5. Reboot the board and restore the DIP switch to the [qSPI boot](../hailo-15-based-products/hailo-15-other-articles/hummingboard-hailo-15-boot-select.md).
