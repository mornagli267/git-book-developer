Solid-Run’s Hummingboard Gate official supports MikroElektronika mikroBus for the Click-Boards.

MikroElektronika is constantly expanding its range of click boards™, small extension boards with a standardized mikroBUS™ pinout that offer easy hardware expandability and rapid prototyping for embedded developers. The current range has over 150 click boards™, with new ones being added almost weekly. The mikroBUS™ pinout is what makes designing and prototyping with click boards™ so simple. Developers can just plug a clickboard into a corresponding mikroBUS™ socket, instantly connecting it to a target development platform without having to perform any additional hardware settings. MikroElektronika’s latest generation of development boards carry mikroBUS™ sockets; the company also offers a line of simple shields that add mikroBUS™ connectivity to today’s popular development platforms like Raspberry Pi®, BeagleBone, LaunchPad™, Discovery, or Arduino. The pinout itself comprises two 1×8 female headers containing all the pins that are used by the many different modules found on 150+ click boards™.

### Specification

The mikroBUS™ standard defines mainboard sockets and add-on boards used for interfacing microcontrollers or microprocessors (mainboards) with integrated circuits and modules (add-on boards). The standard specifies the physical layout of the mikroBUS™ pinout, the communication and power supply pins used, the size and shape of the add-on boards, the positioning of the mikroBUS™ socket on the mainboard, and finally, the silkscreen marking conventions for both the add-on boards and sockets. The purpose of mikroBUS™ is to enable easy hardware expandability with a large number of standardized compact add-on boards, each one carrying a single sensor, transceiver, display, encoder, motor driver, connection port, or any other electronic module or integrated circuit. Created by MikroElektronika, mikroBUS™ is an open standard — anyone can implement mikroBUS™ in their hardware design, as long as the requirements set by this document are being met.
