| LX2 COM express SYSRESET# input signal | <p>LX2 COM express SYSRESET# signal was implemented with a bi-directional level shifter as input for the COMe. The level shifter gets “confused” when assembling capacitors due to it’s internal single shot implementation and might create a “reset loop” condution, or system not booting that the reset button must be clicked.<br><br>The affecting capacitor on the COM express is C3, refer to the image below (*)</p> | 1.3 to  1.6, part of 1.7 | <p>The workaround is to disassemble C3 from the COM express (and C94 on the HoneyComb / ClearFog CX PCBs)<br><br>The fix is already implemented on part of the PCB rev 1.7, when the issue was found debugged and deployed.<br><br>Future revisions will not have C3 assembled.</p> |

(\*) Below is an image showing the placement of C3 capacitor on all boards up to rev 1.6 between the reset button and the boot DIP switch.

| LX2 SoC production long term reliability | <p>LX2 long term reliability testing showed the requirement of the below modification, in board level. Those issues were not observed in the lab, but only on long term reliability testing (by NXP) –<br><br>1. Use SD / micro SD interface 1.8 to 3.3v level shifter instead of using the native 1.8/3.3v tolerence.<br>2. Pull up USB1_VBUS and USB2_VBUS to 5V instead of shorting it to 5V.</p> | 1.3 to  1.6, fixed in 1.7 | <p>No software modifications required to support the level shifter in rev 1.7.<br><br>No valid hardware or software workarounds to accomodate those issues in PCBs rev 1.3 .. 1.6</p> |

#### LX2160A- from rev 1.5 to rev 1.6 feature enhancement

| This is not an errata but addition of a feature | <p>Added 1588 signals by wiring those signals to the 10G_SDP* signals of COM with addition of using few reserved pins.<br><br>Note that all those signals are coming directory from the processor and are 1.8v voltage level.</p> | 1.5, addition reflected in rev 1.6 |   |

This pull-up is not functional after changing their function to UART0/1 TX; due to that booting from SD and then booting from different source that requires using the LX2160A internal pull-up will capture the wrong boot source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 1.3, fixed in 1.4    | Issue is fixed in rev 1.4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| I2C level shifter signal reflection       | 1.8v to 3.3v I2C level shifter on the COM express module has a high rise time which creates a reflection on the 3.3v domain. In rare occasions this reflection might create a signal dip on the I2C clock signal that might get interpreted wrongly as a clock rise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1.3, fixed in 1.4    | Issue is fixed in rev 1.4 by adding a damping resistor. As a symptom to this issue when booting and I2C SPD eeproms are not read correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| MDC/MDIO level signal reflection          | 1.8v to 3.3v open-drain level shifters used to MDC/MDIO signals level shifting has high rise time which creates signal reflection on both signals. The critical signal is the clock and it’s connected to the on COM 1Gbps phy and the COM express headers on C16 and and C46 COM headers. When C16 and C46 are not used they can reflect the clock that will disturb the rising edge of the clock on the 1Gbps phy and thus creates wrong reads from the phy and loosing the link since the kernel polls the phy’s register regularly | 1.3, fixed in 1.4    | Issue is fixed in rev 1.4. Rev 1.3 users are required to add a 49.9 ohm and 150pF RC filter. If a new carrier board is being designed add this RC filter near C16 COM express header (EMI1…MDC).                                                                                                                                                                                   |
