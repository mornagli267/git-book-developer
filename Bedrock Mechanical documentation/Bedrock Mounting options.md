# Bedrock Mounting options

The compact footprint of Bedrock, robust structure, effective fanless cooling and DC input tolerance simplify Bedrock integration. All Bedrock I/O is brought to the front panel, with DC input and antennas in the top panel. The bottom and rear panel are both reserved for mounting, allowing full usability while Bedrock is mounted to a wall or to a desk.

SolidRun offers multiple types of mounting brackets, including lever-based DIN-Rail bracket with locking, wall mount, small stand and ruggedized stand.

Bedrock is designed for effective deployment as a DIN Rail mounted IPC with the following features:

- Small, thin and shallow form factor
- Passive cooling from both sides
- All connectors and indicators on the front panel. Power and antennas on the top panel
- No vents
- Fortified rear panel for mounting

SolidRun offers an advanced DIN Rail mounting bracket for Bedrock PC with the following features:

- All metal bracket (aluminum body and hardened steel latch)
- Easy positioning by lowering the IPC onto the DIN rail
- Zero-force mounting (without spring loading)
- Low-force clamping mechanism with easy access
- Quick dismounting and remounting
- Bracket locking prevents accidental dismounting

Bedrock Wall Mounting Bracket is designed for simple one-time fixing Bedrock to a wall using only two screws.  
The bracket has the following features:

- Anodized aluminum Made by CNC
- Ensures space below and above the computer for effective convection cooling
- Easy access to connectors and indicators
- Robustness - Bedrock is screwed to the bracket, then bracket is screwed to the wall

## Stand

![](../../../attachments/b6fbf562-6e4e-4117-84f4-39ad552a9f8d.png)

The Bedrock Stand is designed for using Bedrock on a desk. It elevates Bedrock above the desk for cooling and keeps it stable in vertical position.

The stand is made of aluminum by CNC with anodize finish and has anti-slip slicone rubber sole.

All Bedrock features are accessible without removing the Stand.  
The Stand is recommended for Bedrock evaluation.

## Bedrock Tile mounting

![](../../../attachments/3026b707-0fb1-47cc-8226-4385276b6564.png)

When integrating an IPC in tight space convection cooling becomes ineffective and is better replaced with conduction cooling. It is also desirable to make the IPC as compact and thin as possible.

Bedrock Tile is designed for these use cases. The ribbed chassis walls are replaced with flat walls with blind threadings for fastening Bedrock Tile to a cold plate. A key feature of Bedrock Tile is that it preserves the 360º internal heat distribution so it can be cooled from either side. With thickness of just 29mm and volume of 0.6 liter, Bedrock Tile is easy to integrate in tight spaces. Having all connectors on one side further simplifies the integration.

### Mounting guidelines

For effective passive cooling of Bedrock please consider the following:
